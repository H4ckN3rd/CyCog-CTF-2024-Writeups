# Run Run Run! (50)

Go on, don't be afraid, just run the file and you'll get what you're looking for...

## Solution

Download the file...

Then we use file command to see the type of file it is.
```bash
file run_me
```
Now it says it is an executable file so i used “chmod +x run_me” command to make the file executable and run it.
```bash
chmod +x run_me
./run_me
```
